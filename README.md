# 👋 Hi, I'm Eduardo Villalpando Mello

I’m a software engineer who cares deeply about design, innovation, and the small details that make technology delightful. I’m passionate about building tools and solutions that empower developers—and people—to create meaningful change in the world.

- 💡 I love designing and developing intuitive, robust software, always with an eye for user experience and the details that matter.
- 🌍 I believe technology should solve real problems and make a positive impact, whether in business, education, or society.
- 🛠️ Currently at Microsoft, working on the .NET SDK, CLI, and developer tools, focusing on improving the experience for developers worldwide.
- 🏆 Open source contributor to projects like MSBuild, dotnet/sdk, and odoo/odoo, helping shape the tools that power millions of users.
- 🧑‍💻 Previously at Odoo, where I developed business solutions, enhanced global development tools, and created new CI/CD tools to automate and streamline processes.
- 🚀 I thrive on exploring new ideas through personal projects and hackathons—experimenting, innovating, and building things just for fun or to solve interesting challenges.
- 🤝 I enjoy collaborating, mentoring, and learning from diverse teams and communities, and I’m always eager to help others grow.
- 🕹️ Outside of work, I love tinkering with technology, contributing to programming clubs, and co-authoring research on topics like fake news detection and urban data visualization.
- 🏅 Achievements: Multiple GitHub recognitions (Pair Extraordinaire, Pull Shark, YOLO, Arctic Code Vault Contributor) and active contributor to open source and community projects.
